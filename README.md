## About
h-rs is a Rust port of the [h](https://github.com/savetheinternet/h) program. It aims to be entirely compatible with the original [h](https://github.com/savetheinternet/h) program.

H is a small program which, upon execution, prints the lowercase letter `h` (ASCII character 104).

## Usage
1.	`cargo build --release`
2.	`./target/release/h`
